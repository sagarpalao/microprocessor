This repository is a collection of the experiments I performed during my college laboratories of Microprocessor using TASM. I built this repository as a humble and unpretentious effort to help students. 

It includes:
1. Adding 8 bit numbers
2. Adding 16 bit numbers
3. Movement of data from Data Segment to Extra Segment
4. Divide 16 bit number with 8 bit number
5. Find Larget number in an array
6. Logical Instructions
7. Multiply 8 bit numbers
8. Multiply 16 bit numbers
9. Palindrome
10. Find Smallest number in aa array
11. Basic String Operations
